Overview

Initialization:
Initialize the robot positions and configurations in the simulation environment.
Set up communication channels among robots using ROS topics and messages.

SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping):
Implement Gmapping SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) to enable robots to build a map of the environment.
Ensure that each robot maintains an accurate representation of its own position within the map.

Consensus Algorithm (Distributed A):*
Implement the Distributed A* algorithm for consensus among robots.
The goal is to achieve a common understanding of the environment among all robots.

Task Allocation (Auction-Based):
Design and implement an auction-based task allocation strategy.
Define tasks or goals that robots can accomplish in the environment.
Robots bid for tasks based on their capabilities, distance, or other relevant factors.
Allocate tasks to robots with the highest bids, ensuring a fair distribution of tasks.

Communication:
Establish a robust communication framework using ROS.
Implement communication protocols to share information about tasks, maps, and current robot states.
Ensure that robots can effectively exchange data for coordination and collaboration.

Collision Avoidance:
Integrate collision avoidance mechanisms to prevent conflicts between robots.
Implement algorithms or strategies to ensure that robots navigate the environment safely without colliding with each other.

Execution Flow

Initialization:
Set up ROS nodes for each robot.
Initialize robot positions and communication channels.

SLAM:
Launch Gmapping SLAM for mapping and localization.
Periodically update the map as the robots explore the environment.

Consensus and Task Allocation:
Execute the Distributed A* algorithm for consensus among robots.
Implement the auction-based task allocation strategy.
Continuously update task assignments based on changing conditions.

Communication:
Establish and maintain communication channels.
Share information about maps, current positions, and allocated tasks.

Collision Avoidance:
Continuously monitor the environment for obstacles and other robots.
Adjust robot paths in real-time to avoid collisions.

Termination
The algorithm can continue to run until a predefined condition is met (e.g., all tasks completed, a specific time limit reached, etc.).

This algorithm provides a foundation for multi-robot coordination and collaboration, but specific details may need to be tailored based on the unique aspects of your project and the characteristics of the simulation environment.
